This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Ruby related to how methods interact with instance variables.  The `bug.rb` file shows the erroneous code that doesn't update the instance variable when assigning a value to the getter method. The `bugSolution.rb` file provides the corrected implementation. This issue highlights the importance of understanding Ruby's object model and how to correctly modify instance variables.
